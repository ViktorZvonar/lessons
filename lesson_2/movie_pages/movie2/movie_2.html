				<h2>What it's about</h2>
				<p>
					Marty McFly, a typical American teenager of the Eighties, is
					accidentally sent back to 1955 in a plutonium-powered DeLorean "time
					machine" invented by a slightly mad scientist. During his often
					hysterical, always amazing trip back in time, Marty must make certain
					his teenage parents-to-be meet and fall in love - so he can get back
					to the future
