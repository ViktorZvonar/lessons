				<h2>What it's about</h2>
				<p>
					Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts.
					There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar
					travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar
					system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before,
					a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life
