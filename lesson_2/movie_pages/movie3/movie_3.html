				<h2>What it's about</h2>
				<p>
					Tom Popper grew up having very little interaction with his father, who
					was off exploring the world. When he grows up, he spends most of time
					on his work and ignores his children. One day his father sends him an
					unusual gift: a penguin. Popper can't help but wonder why his father
					would send him a penguin. He tries to get rid of it, but accidentally
					orders five more. When his children and ex-wife show up to celebrate
					his son's birthday, the kids are taken with the penguins. And Popper
					finally gets to connect with his kids while his work suffers
