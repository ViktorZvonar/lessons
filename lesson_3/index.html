      <p class="section-text">
        Ukraine's history is characterized by periods of independence and
        periods under the control of different empires. The territory of
        modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. Over the centuries,
        various parts of Ukraine were ruled by many powers, including the
        Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Ottoman Empire, and the
        Austro-Hungarian Empire.

      <p class="section-text">
        In the 20th century, Ukraine became a part of the Soviet Union until
        it declared independence on August 24, 1991, following the dissolution
        of the USSR. Since independence, Ukraine has been transitioning to a
        market economy and a democratic government but has faced challenges
        such as corruption, political instability, and conflicts.

      <h2 class="section-title">War with russia</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        The most significant recent event in Ukraine's history is the ongoing
        war with russia. Tensions escalated in 2014 when russia annexed Crimea
        following the Ukrainian revolution. This move was widely condemned by
        the international community. The conflict extended into the eastern
        part of Ukraine, where fighting between Ukrainian government forces
        and separatist rebels supported by russia has persisted.
